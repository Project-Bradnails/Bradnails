Disable your internet<br>

If prompted with a Smart Screen box, click run. Game will still be alright.
<br>

<br>
<h2>Tips</h2>
We VERY heavily recommend to always run your games when you have disconnected your internet. This can save both you and us a lot of issues later down the road.
<br>
We recommend running all your games on a "different desktop." You can do this by pressing Windows + tab and pressing the new desktop button. This way if staff is trying to check your computer, they likely will only see your actual work.
<br>
To access games easier, right click the application create a shortcut. You can drag this shortcut anywhere, making it convenient to access
<br>
If you have your work on the same desktop as your games, you can avoid getting caught by pressing Alt + Tab to quickly switch tabs back to your work
<br>
<h2>FAQ:</h2>
Is this a virus or a scam?
<br>
Nope, don't worry. Our team of 6 checks everything to make sure it's functional before uploading to the software list.
<br><br>
How do you access a game?<br>
<br>
Click on a button from the games tab, which is a hyperlink that will then take you to the Google drive.
<br><br>
My computer says it isn't a Microsoft Store Verified App?
<br>
Disable your Internet, that will disable SmartScreen, the system used to force the Microsoft Store screen.
<br><br>
My game still won't run?
<br>
Not all games will work on every computer. It's best to make sure you have DirectX, which is used for lots of games. It may or may not be a driver issue or missing system files, which cannot be fixed as administrator permissions are required.
<br><br>
What is an Emulator? What are ROMs?
<br>
An emulator is software used to imitate and replicate old console hardware so a computer can run the games for this hardware. ROMs are the games themselves. We use RetroArch as the main emulator here, as it has multiple "cores" inside it, which allows it to act as an all in one emulator. We will upload our own ROMs, but if you can't find one you are looking for, check vimm.net, run a google search for "[Game] google drive"* , or download from another ROMs site like The ROMs Depot and reupload onto Google Drive so you can redownload it onto your laptop
<br><br>
How do I install my own games?
<br>
We can't add every possible game ever, so if you want to install your own game, feel free to do so with this information. To install your own games, go to your home computer, download the game, compact the game files into a .zip and upload to Google Drive, MEGA, or DropBox. Then redownload on the school computer, unzip, and play. If the game uses an install.exe, run the installer and then take the files from it and do the same as the above. For this, make sure to double check the %AppData% and %LocalAppData% folders for any other game files. If there are game files there, add them to the folder you are compressing into a .zip, and once you unzip on the laptop, add them back to where they came from (either the %AppData% folder or %LocalAppData% folder.
<br><br>
How do I install game mods?
<br>
If you're looking to install mods for a game, do the same process as you would do when installing your own game. You may also want to check if the game needs a mod manager, as many do. Follow the instructions the mod manager provides you in that circumstance.
<br><br>
Will I get caught?
<br>
If you've followed our advice and used your own wits, we certainly hope not, but there isn't any guarantee. My best advice would be to always check if a teacher is close by. It can save you the trouble.
<br><br>
How do I uninstall my games?
<br>
Delete the folder you downloaded.
<br>
Delete any game save data in your “Documents” folder.
<br>
Type “%appdata%” in the windows search bar, delete any settings configs or save data related to the game you downloaded. Clear your recycling bin.
<br>
Not all games will write data to your Documents or appdata folder, if you aren’t sure if it’s a game file, don’t delete it!
<br>
If you want to save game progress, you can keep your saves on a flash drive or separate computer.
<br>
If you want to take an extra step in being safe, delete both your web history and your downloaded file history.
